\section{Objective and approach}

In this project, we are going to create a remote shell to communicate between a client and a server through a Message Passing Interface.

To do this, we are going to implement a Python program using the following as main libraries:

\begin{itemize}
    \item pycryptodome: to encode then encrypt and decode then decrypt data for security
    \item mpi4py: to set up a remote shell with MPI
\end{itemize}
